          <p>You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. </p>

          <p>.... And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew.

So .... Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the <a href="paragraph-link">Vatican assassins. </a>Just some test words.</p>
          <p>The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' -now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! </p>
